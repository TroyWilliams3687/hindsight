# Information

# This is a template Makefile that will house all of the variables we need for
# Python projects. All of the variables that can be different from project to
# project. The idea is to rename this file to `Makefile.env` and update the
# variables to point to the correct location.

# NOTE: This file should not be in version control.


# -----------
# Variables

# -----
# PYPATH - The location to the bin folder of the python installation to use

# We can set an environment variable and use that. For example we can set the
# variable in`~/.bashrc` to something like python=`~/opt/python_3.9.5/bin`

# Alternatively, we can set the path directly.

# PYPATH?=$(python) <- extract the path from an environment variable

PYPATH?=~/opt/python_3.9.5/bin

# -----
# PY - The name of the python binary to use

PY?=$(PYPATH)/python3.9


# -----
# VENV - The name of the virtual environment to use

VENV=.venv

# -----
# BIN - The path to the bin folder in the virtual environment. We define this
# so we can use the correct binaries

BIN?=$(VENV)/bin
